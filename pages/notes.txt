/* 
Go through the CSS Grid Garden Game
https://cssgridgarden.com/

- Some of the levels are actually ridiculous, so do the best you can
*/

Go through the MDN Docs on these concepts and apply them on your own:
- position property (static, relative, sticky, fixed, absolute)
- float
*/

  - phone
  - start date, end date
  - 2 radio buttons
  - 3 checkboxes
  - Something needs to be required (you choose which fields make sense)

/* 
Replicate the google.com landing page.
- Make a replica as close as you possibly can using all of the tools we've gone over so far.
- Use CSS Grid for the page layout.
- I want actual links (though they can be dead), and icons that are closely related to what you see on the page, etc....
- Make it responsive

hint on the input:
 - style divs around the sides of the input to match it so you can use the icons a bit easier.
